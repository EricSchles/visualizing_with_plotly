#Examples using plotly

This simple repository will include a set of examples of how to use plotly to generate different graphs.  This repo is broken out into three major files - 

* `helpers.py` - this file contains a number of data transformations that can be used to do ETL into plotly charts
* `plots.py` - this file contains a number of plots of randomly generated data
* `run.py` - this file can be thought of as the main method for the program.  All plots should be run through here.
